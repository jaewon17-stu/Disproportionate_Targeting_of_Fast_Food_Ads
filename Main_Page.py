<h2 style="font-size: 24px;">Introduction: The Disproportionate Targeting of Fast Food Ads</h2>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">
In recent years, a concerning trend has emerged in the media landscape: fast food advertisements are being disproportionately targeted to minority groups. Research shows that these ads are strategically placed on television channels, streaming platforms, and digital spaces where these communities are most likely to engage. This targeted approach is not accidental; it's driven by a combination of marketing tactics and media consumption patterns. As a result, these advertisements reach individuals who are already vulnerable to the health risks associated with poor dietary choices, particularly in communities where access to healthy food options is limited.

The constant exposure to fast food ads has been linked to unhealthy eating habits, particularly among adolescents and low-income families. These ads often promote calorie-dense, nutrient-poor food, which contributes to the rising rates of obesity, diabetes, and other health disparities in these populations. The intentional placement of these ads in spaces where minority groups consume media raises serious ethical concerns, as it not only exploits these communities but also exacerbates existing health inequalities.

This website aims to shed light on the tactics behind the disproportionate targeting of fast food ads, the consequences it has on public health, and the broader implications of marketing strategies that prioritize profit over peopleâ€™s well-being.
