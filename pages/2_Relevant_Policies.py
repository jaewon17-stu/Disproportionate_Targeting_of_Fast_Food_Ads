<h2 style="font-size: 24px;">Policies to Alleviate the Disproportionate Targeting of Fast Food Ads</h2>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">
Several policies are being proposed and enacted to address the disproportionate targeting of fast food advertisements to vulnerable populations, particularly minority groups. In some regions, regulations are being introduced to limit the marketing of unhealthy food to children, with stricter rules around advertisements during children's programming on television and digital platforms. Additionally, initiatives such as nutritional labeling and restrictions on ads for unhealthy foods in certain public spaces aim to reduce the impact of these ads on communities most affected by poor dietary choices. Some countries have also started to require food companies to contribute to public health campaigns to offset the negative effects of their advertising strategies. However, these policies face significant limitations. Many regulations only apply to certain media channels or age groups, leaving gaps where fast food ads can still reach vulnerable communities. Furthermore, the global nature of advertising and the rise of online platforms make it difficult to effectively regulate ad placements, as digital marketing often circumvents traditional rules. Additionally, enforcement of these policies is often inconsistent, and the growing power of food industry lobbyists can undermine efforts to tighten restrictions.
